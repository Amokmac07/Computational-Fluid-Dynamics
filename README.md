    <h1>Computational Fluid Dynamics Project: 2D Triangulation</h1>
    <p>This course project explores the use of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) techniques for simulating physical systems. We delved into a specific area of CFD known as triangulation, focusing on the advancing front method.</p>
    <h2>Triangulation of Arbitrary Shapes</h2>
    <p>The project involved developing code to perform triangulation using the advancing front method on any 2D shape. The code requires a limited number of coordinates to define the shape.</p>
    <p>For example, consider an arbitrary shape like this:</p>
    <img src="Pics/shape.jpg" alt="Arbitrary Shape" style="width: 350px;">
    <h2>Triangulation Visualization </h2>
    <p>Upon running the code, the triangulation of the given shape would be a series of interconnected triangles that approximate the original shape's boundary. These triangles would form a mesh suitable for further CFD calculations.</p>
    <p>Here's a GIF demonstrating the triangulation process for a similar shape:</p>
