# Computational Fluid Dynamics Project: 2D Triangulation
This course project explores the application of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) techniques, specifically focusing on triangulation using the advancing front method for 2D shapes.

## Triangulation of Arbitrary Shapes
The project involved developing code to perform triangulation on any 2D shape using the advancing front method. The code requires only a minimal set of coordinates to define the shape's boundary.

For example, consider an arbitrary shape like this:

Arbitrary Shape: Image of Arbitrary Shape: 

<img src="Pics/shape.jpg" alt="Arbitrary Shape" style="width: 350px;">

## Triangulation Visualization
Upon running the code, the triangulation of the given shape would be a series of interconnected triangles that approximate the original shape's boundary. These triangles form a mesh suitable for further CFD calculations.

## Key Points
The advancing front method provides an efficient approach for 2D triangulation.
The code requires a small number of coordinates to define the shape.
The resulting triangulation mesh serves as the foundation for CFD simulations.
